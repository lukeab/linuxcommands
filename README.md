# linuxcommands
Little repo of funky commands, in development, bash python ruby or whatever. 

Tools still to come(idea list):
 * aws account cluster ssh wrapper (done):white_check_mark:
 * see if we can get some of the commands working on mac (I'll have to get a mac)
 * mfatool bash and oh-my-zsh plugin for autocomplete would be nice
 * some zsh plugins for github
 
####Installation
Unless the system gets much more advanced I suggest just cloning the repo, then symlink scripts to your path( eg. ~/bin ) as needed.


##Tools
 - [multi factor authentication tool](docs/mfatool.md)
 - [list ec2 Instances](docs/listec2instances.md)
 - [cluster ssh ec2](docs/clustersshec2.md)
