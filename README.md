Little repo of funky commands, in development, bash python ruby or whatever. 

Tools still to come(idea list):
 * aws account cluster ssh wrapper (done):white_check_mark:

####Installation
Unless the system gets much more advanced I suggest just cloning the repo, then symlink scripts to your path( eg. ~/bin ) as needed.
