# linuxcommands
Little repo of funky commands, in development, bash python ruby or whatever.


##Tools

### mfatool:
Simple bash script, a utility to retrieve stored keys for multifactor authentication totp codes. Works much like google authenticator, tested with gmail, amazon aws, github, akamai luna, bitbucket. 
Should work with most services that use totp, time base code generation.
##### Dependencies: secret-tool, oathtool
